    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Mozzarella – fresh mozzarella (like this log commonly found in grocery stores) is best. Or substitute fresh mozzarella balls packed in water, or burrata cheese.</li>
        <li>Tomatoes– be sure your tomatoes are not overly ripe.  You want them to be slightly firm with a copper red coloring. Use a serrated knife to get a good cut.</li>
        <li>Basil– use small whole leaves, or rip larger basil leaves gently, by hand, rather than cutting them with a knife.</li>
        <li>Extra Virgin Olive oil- lightly drizzled on top. I like to use a good quality, that’s pure extra virgin.</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper– to taste.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How to:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Slice Cheese and Tomato: Slice a large log of fresh mozzarella and a large tomato. I like to use a serrated knife, to get a good clean cut. Sprinkle a little bit of salt on your tomato slices.</li>
        <li>Assemble: Arrange salad by alternately laying slices of tomato and mozzarella on a plate.
            Drizzle a little bit of olive oil over top (this serves as the caprese salad dressing). Tuck basil leaves throughout, or sprinkle them on top. Garnish with a little sprinkle of salt and pepper.</li>
    </ul>
